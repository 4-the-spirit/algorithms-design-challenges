def optimize_matrix_multiplication(dimensions):
    """
    Question:
    The multiplication of a matrix series A_1 x A_2 x ... x A_n is only valid
    when the dimensions match correctly. Specifically, if r_i represents the
    number of rows in matrix A_i, and c_i represents its number of columns,
    then for the multiplication to be valid, it must hold that c_i = r_{i+1}
    for all 1 <= i < n.

    When A_i x A_(i+1) is computed, the resulting matrix has r_i rows and
    c_{i+1} columns, and the time complexity of the multiplication is
    Î˜(r_i x c_i x c_{i+1}) operations.

    Since matrix multiplication is associative, parentheses can be placed
    in any order, such as (A_1 x A_2) x A_3 or A_1 x (A_2 x A_3). The order
    in which the matrices are multiplied can greatly affect the total number
    of operations required.

    Design an algorithm that, given a list of matrix dimensions
    [(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), ..., (r_n, c_n)], finds the optimal way to
    parenthesize the matrix chain multiplication to minimize the number of
    operations.
